I was introduced to Machine Learning towards the latter of my final year project of my undergraduate program. I learned how to use Programming in Embedded Systems and then the areas where Machine Learning is used. 

I've grown a love for programming over the years and have tried out data analysis projects, Machine Learning projects and web development projects. This repository holds all of my personal projects that I've done as a programmer.
