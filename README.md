## Background

Hello!

I did my undergraduate at Unnited college of Engineering and Research where I majored in Electronics and Communication Technology with an emphasis on applications computational sciences. In my undergraduate studies, I build my interest in Embedded Systems and worked on numerous project using various microprocessors but while bulding my final year major project i.e. Magic Mirror i got to learn about Machine Learning and from then i started learning about various Data Science Technologies like Regression, Classification and Sentiment Analysis using various platforms like Python and R. Curretly i am also persuing my full time Post Graduation Diploma in Data Analytics from Imarticus Learning, New Delhi.

Now I focus on programming for whatever problems come my way, diving deep into the data to get insights and conducting analysis on topics that interest me!
